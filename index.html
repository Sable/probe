ProBe: Data formats for recording Program Behaviour
</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
During an open discussion session at 
<a href="http://www.st.cs.uni-sb.de/paste/">PASTE 2004</a>,
one issue discussed was that researchers working on
program analysis tools (both static and dynamic) too rarely compare
their actual analysis results to those produced by other tools.
Such comparisons are difficult because published results rarely
include complete program analysis results. Even when the tools
are available, different tools often use very different
representations of programs being analyzed, making it difficult
to compare their results.
</P>

<p>
ProBe is an attempt to begin to change this unfortunate state,
and make it easier to both report and compare results of different
program analysis tools. The motivation for ProBe came from an
e-mail exchange between
<a href="http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/">Ond&#345;ej Lhot&aacute;k</a>,
<a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~rountev/">Nasko Rountev</a>, and
<a href="http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~djp/">David J. Pearce</a>.
We agreed that the following were needed:
<ul>
<li>standard data formats for recording analysis results,
independent of any particular tool
<li>a library to make it easy for analysis tools to produce output in the formats
<li>tools for analyzing, visualizing, and comparing analysis results recorded
in the formats
</ul>
</p>

<p>ProBe, then, is a prototype implementation of the above requirements.
Specifically, ProBe consists of a collection of data formats for
results of several common program analyses for Java, and tools for writing
and reading/analyzing the analysis results. Of course, in order to become
standard, a data format must be accepted by the community interested in
a particular program analysis, and this undoubtedly requires discussion
within the community. Thus, the existing data formats are not intended
to be definitive; rather, they are intended as starting points for such
discussions. That said, code is already available for generating analysis
results in the formats from <a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/">Soot</a>
and <a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/starj/">*J</a>. All of the formats
come with simple analysis tools, and the Call Graph format in particular
comes with a more comprehensive collection of analysis tools.
</p>

<h2>Data Formats</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="schemas/callgraph.html">call graph</a>
<li><a href="schemas/polymorphic.html">polymorphic call sites</a>
<li><a href="schemas/pointsto.html">points-to information</a>
<li><a href="schemas/failcast.html">cast safety</a>
<li><a href="schemas/sideeffect.html">side effect information</a>
</ul>

<h2>Library</h2>
The Java library is intended to be used in program analysis
tools to generate output in the ProBe formats, and in evaluation
tools to read the ProBe formats.
<a href="doc/javadoc/index.html">Javadoc documentation</a> is available.

<h2>Analysis/Evaluation Tools</h2>
Analysis and evaluation tools are specific to each individual data format,
and are listed on the web page for their data format. See above
for the links to the data formats.

<h2>Download</h2>
ProBe is developed in a publicly readable Subversion repository at:

<pre>https://svn.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/probe/</pre>

The ProBe build process generates a <a href="lib/probe.jar">Jar file</a>
containing the Java classes of the ProBe library and tools.

A <a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/~olhota/build/probe-all.jar">nightly
build</a> containing all of ProBe is available.
