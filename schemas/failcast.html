</h1>
<h2>Specification</h2>
<h3>Schema</h3>
<img src="failcast.png">
<h3>Nodes</h3>
<h4>Root</h4>
Each cast safety graph has a single Root node, which does not correspond
to any element of the program. It is used as the starting point of
fails and executes edges. The Root node has no attributes.

<h4>Stmt</h4>
Each Stmt node represents a checkcast bytecode
instruction in the program. The offset attribute is the bytecode offset
of the instruction in the method in which it appears.

<h4>Method</h4>
Each Method node represents a method in the program. The name attribute
specifies the name of the method. The signature attribute specifies the
parameters and return type (but not the name) of the method in the same
format as they are stored in the a Method Descriptor in the Java class
file format (see <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/">The
Java Virtual Machine Specification</a>, section 4.3.3).

<h4>Class</h4>
Each Class node represents a class in the program. The name attribute
specifies the name of the class, not including the package. For inner
classes, the name is determined as in the Java class file (i.e.
the name may contain $ signs). The package attribute specifies the
package in which the class is defined, with subpackages separated
by a period.

<h3>Edges</h3>
<h4>fails</h4>
If a checkcast bytecode instruction fails (i.e. causes a
ClassCastException to be thrown) during the execution of the program, a
fails edge appears from the Root node to the Stmt node representing the
checkcast instruction.

<h4>executes</h4>
If a checkcast bytecode instruction executes (regardless of whether
the check succeeds or not) during the execution of the program, an
executes edge appears from the Root node to the Stmt node representing
the checkcast instruction.

<h4>declaredIn</h4>
Each Method node has exactly one declaredIn edge to the Class node
corresponding to the class in which the method is declared.

<h4>inBody</h4>
Each Stmt node has exactly one inBody edge to the Method node
corresponding to the method in whose body the corresponding bytecode
instruction appears.

<h2>Tools</h2>
<h3>FailCastInfo</h3>
The FailCastInfo tool counts the number of cast instructions that
execute and that fail. Optionally, it can also print lists of these
casts.
<pre>
Usage: java probe.FailCastInfo [options] failcast.gxl
  -a : print list of all cast statements
  -v : print list of potentially failing cast statements
  -lib file : ignore methods in packages listed in file
